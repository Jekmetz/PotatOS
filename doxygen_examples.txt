Below is an example of what needs to go before every element in any set of code.
I still need to decide on what to do with *.h files. I am requesting the teams input in this.
Below is just an example of what could be included. Remove things if needed. For instance, if
you do not need a code segment, just remove it. 

Use the doxygen_config_file to generate the doxygen files. You can apt install doxygen to install
the program on your machine. To run doxygen and generate files, 
"doxygen doxygen_config_file"
This will only create documentation on .c and .h files inside of modules/m1/* currently. We need to 
decide if we are documenting the project that we were gave or just our code. 

If anyone has any questions just text me. 

Other notes. The "*" at the begining of every line is inportant. Doxygen doesnt know what to do without it.
The first "//" and the last "*/" are the code blocks that doxygen recognizes. So "//" is not recognized and 
can be used for our internal code review and documentation. I have included TODO at the top. I believe that
we have removed TODO from everywhere in our code. So you should be able to search for TODO in the code to 
see areas that still need completed. Once you finish a section, please remove the TODO so we know that the
section is done. 

I included the doxygen comments in command_handler.c and commands.c. You can refer to those files to see
the below code used in examples.


// TODO
